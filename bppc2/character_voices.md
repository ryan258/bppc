## Writing Guidelines

1. **Stay in character** - Each voice should be distinct
2. **Layer the meta** - Hints before reveals
3. **Respect the 1960s setting** - No anachronistic language
4. **Build empathy** - Even under meta-pressure, characters remain human
5. **Trust the reader** - Let them piece together implications
