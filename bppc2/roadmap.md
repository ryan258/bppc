## Quality Assurance Milestones

### QA Checkpoint 1 (After Phase 2)
- [ ] 7-minute QA script passes
- [ ] No external file writes
- [ ] Basic meta mechanics functional

### QA Checkpoint 2 (After Phase 4)
- [ ] All endings reachable
- [ ] Mercy timer calibrated (15s/20s/30s variants)
- [ ] Accessibility toggles working

### Final QA (After Phase 6)
- [ ] Full 60-90 minute playthrough
- [ ] All accessibility features verified
- [ ] Cross-platform builds (Win/Mac/Linux)
- [ ] No crashes, no external file access

---

## Technical Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Save System Security** - Never touch OS files
2. **Performance** - 60fps target, shader-free drift
3. **Accessibility** - All features toggleable
4. **Platform Support** - Desktop focus (Win/Mac/Linux)

### Architecture Decisions
- Use ATL transforms for drift effects (no shaders)
- Custom screens for meta elements
- Persistent storage for memory features
- Modular character/scene system

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
- **Centerfold Mechanics** - Complex UI interaction
- **Haunted Load** - Save system manipulation
- **Cross-platform Audio** - Timing precision

### Contingency Plans
- Prototype complex mechanics early
- Fallback to simpler implementations if needed
- Platform-specific testing throughout

---

## Definition of Done

**Ready to Ship When:**
- [ ] All 6 phases complete
- [ ] QA script passes (7-minute critical path)
- [ ] Accessibility checklist verified
