## One-liner
_A wholesome 1960s teen-digest that slowly realizes you’re the editor._

## Long
Build poems, pass notes, and hang at a chrome-trim diner in a lovingly halftoned visual novel. Your clicks have weight. Reloading to fix things tightens the gutters; dwelling on a line makes the color slip. When the book offers a “bonus centerfold,” the kindest choice is to leave it bound. **Blue Pencil** is about attention, not fear—an interactive argument that sometimes love is a period.

## Features bullets:
- Digest-era linework, CMYK dots, intentional misregistration
- A **Mercy Ending** unlocked by doing nothing
- Haunted saves (illusion only), fake tracebacks (safe theatricality)
- Letters page that mirrors how you play
- Post-credits **Honest Mode** for accessibility & speedruns
